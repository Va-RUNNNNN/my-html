<p>
The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see <u><i>Baahubali: The Beginning</i></u>.
Kattappa continues Amarendra Baahubali's tale. After his victory over the Kalakeyas, Baahubali is declared heir apparent with Bhallaladeva as his commander. Sivagami sends him on a tour of the kingdom in disguise with Kattappa, while she selects a suitable queen for him. During the journey, Baahubali witnesses Princess Devasena of Kunthala bravely repelling attackers, leading to an admiration for her. In disguise, he approaches her and is accepted into the royal palace of Kunthala as a guard.<br>

Bhallaladeva views Devasena's portrait and Sivagami assures their marriage, sending an emissary to Kunthala. Devasena rejects the proposal, and Bijjaladeva tricks Sivagami into ordering Baahubali to capture Devasena. In Kunthala, Baahubali and Kattappa defend the palace from an attack alongside Devasena and her cousin Kumara Varma. Kattappa then reveals Baahubali as the future King of Mahishmati, and Baahubali proposes Devasena for marriage, who agrees. As the misunderstanding is brought to light, Sivagami orders Baahubali to choose between the crown and Devasena, who then chooses Devasena. As a result, Bhallaladeva is crowned King, with Baahubali as his commander, though Baahubali retains his fame with the people.<br>

When Devasena is pregnant, Bhallaladeva removes Baahubali from his position and appoints Sethupathi, a court official. Devasena disagrees publicly with the decision and asks Baahubali to ascend the throne as a gift to her. Baahubali and Devasena are later banished, when Baahubali kills Sethupathi for offending Devasena.<br>

Threatened by Baahubali's unwavering popularity, Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva conspire to turn Sivagami against him. Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Baahubali, Devasena and their child's lives are in danger, who then unsuccessfully tries to assassinate Bhallaladeva after he manages to kill Bhallaladeva's men, and only to be killed by Bijjaladeva after Bijjaladeva scars Bhallaladeva's face to make it look like Kumara Varma tried to assassinate him and reveals to Kumara Varma that he lured him in order to have Sivagami order Baahubali's death. Sivagami, believing that the assassin Kumara Varma was sent by Baahubali, secretly orders Kattappa to kill him. Kattappa lures Baahubali into a secluded place and assassinates him and seeks forgiveness from the dying Baahubali who forgives him and asks him to take care of his mother Sivagami and screams "Jai Mahishmati" before he bleeds out. Bhallaladeva exposes himself as the mastermind behind the plot, and Kattappa conveys this to Sivagami, to her regret. As Devasena arrives with her newborn son, Sivagami declares Baahubali's son Mahendra as the new King. Bhallaladeva however turns the guards against her and she is forced to flee with Mahendra. Bhallaladeva rules for the next twenty-five years as a tyrannical King, and imprisons Devasena who starts to build a funeral pyre for him.<br>

When Kattappa finishes the tale, Sivudu (Mahendra) decides to declare war on Bhallaladeva, assembling the tribals, the resistance and Mahishmati's slave army led by Kattappa. The army lays siege to Mahishmati, while Mahendra breaches the city walls with Kattappa after Bhallaladeva kills Jaya Varma and forcefully takes Devasena with him. He engages Bhallaladeva in a brawl as the army continues the assault, and pins him on Devasena's funeral pyre with chains. Devasena burns Bhallaladeva alive as he pleads to Devasena to die with him and screams in pain as he is dying, ending his reign as Mahendra, Kattappa, Avanthika, the remaining soldiers, and a helpless Bijjaladeva watch. Mahendra is crowned the new King of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen, and pledges to uphold peace and justice. The movies ends with Mahendra saying, "Idi naa maata. Naa maate shasanam (This is my word. My word is the law.) and Bhallaladeva's statue head is dumped into the water."<br>

Baahubali 2: The Conclusion was produced in the Telugu film industry. Unlike the first film, Baahubali 2 was shot primarily in Telugu; however, only certain close-up shots and dialogue scenes—mainly those involving Ramya Krishna, Nassar, and Sathyaraj—were additionally filmed in Tamil to improve lip-sync for the Tamil release. As of July 2015, the film series was considered the most expensive in India.<br>

Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad who wrote stories for most of his films once again gave the story for Baahubali. The series was produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni. R. C. Kamalakannan was chosen as visual effects supervisor and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the editor. PM Satheesh was the sound designer and stunt sequences were coordinated by King Solomon, Lee Whittaker, and Kecha Khamphakdee. The film's costume designers are Rama Rajamouli and Prasanthi Tripuraneni. The line producer was M.M Srivalli. The film shooting started on 17 December 2015 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad with Prabhas and Ramya Krishna. The film featuring actors Prabhas and Rana Daggubati in the lead roles became the biggest ever movie in India in terms of scale of production and making as of 2017. The film is also known by the abbreviation BB2. Sabu Cyril was the production designer and Peter Hein was the choreographer. R. C. Kamalakannan was the VFX supervisor and was assisted by Pete Draper and Adel Adili, co-founder of Makuta VFX. In order for the lip sync to not be noticeable when dubbed in various languages, the film featured less dialogues and more action scenes.

He also underwent training in martial arts under the supervision of a Vietnamese trainer, Tuan. Sathyaraj has a tonsured look for his role in the film. In the end of October 2013, Rana appeared at a fashion show with a beefed up body which, according to him, was a part of his look in the film. In mid-May 2014, reports emerged that Anushka would play a pregnant woman for a few sequences in the second part of the film.<br>

At the same time, Prabhas posted on his Facebook page that he underwent minor shoulder surgery and would join the film's sets in a span of a month.

Prabhas had equipment costing ₹1.5 crore shipped to his home, where he built a personal gym. His breakfast included 40 half-boiled egg whites blended and added with protein powder. In mid-June 2014, Tamannaah Bhatia regarding her role in the film, said that she would be playing the role of a warrior princess named Avanthika and her appearance in the film is completely different when compared to her past films. Before joining the film's shoot, Bhatia did costume trials for the film which she confirmed in her micro-blogging page stating "I am very excited to get on to the set of Baahubali. I did some dress trials today and my look in this movie will be totally new. I have never been seen in such sort of a look till now. It will be a new role for me".
