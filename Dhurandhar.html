Dhurandhar is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language spy action thriller film written, co-produced, and directed by Aditya Dhar. It is produced by Jyoti Deshpande, Aditya Dhar, and Lokesh Dhar under Jio Studios and B62 Studios. The film features an ensemble cast including Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, and R. Madhavan, alongside several supporting actors. Serving as the first instalment of a duology, it centres on a high-stakes covert counter-terrorism operation. The film follows an undercover Indian intelligence agent who infiltrates Karachi's criminal syndicates and political power structures in Pakistan in an effort to dismantle a terror network targeting India.<br>

The film's storyline draws loose inspiration from multiple real-life geopolitical events and conflicts in South Asia, including the 1999 IC-814 hijacking, the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and developments linked to Pakistan's Operation Lyari. Principal photography for Dhurandhar took place from July 2024 to October 2025 across multiple locations in India and abroad, including the states and union territories of Punjab, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, as well as Thailand. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Shashwat Sachdev, while cinematography and editing were handled by Vikash Nowlakha and Shivkumar V. Panicker, respectively. With a runtime of 214 minutes, Dhurandhar ranks among the longest Indian films ever produced.<br>

Dhurandhar was released theatrically on 5 December 2025 and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its cast performances, direction, cinematography, action sequences, musical score, and production design, with criticism being directed toward its extended runtime and pacing. The film also attracted controversy for its blending of fictional elements with real historical events, with some commentators describing it as propagandistic. Commercially, the film achieved significant box-office success, grossing over ₹1,000 crore worldwide within three weeks of release, having beat multiple records, including highest-grossing Hindi film in India and second highest-grossing Hindi film worldwide at the time of its release. A sequel, Dhurandhar: The Revenge, is scheduled for theatrical release on 19 March 2026.<br>

The film was banned from theatrical release in several Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Despite an official ban on Indian films in Pakistan since 2019, Dhurandhar reportedly received approximately two million pirated digital downloads in the country.

<b><i>The film is divided into eight chapters: "The Price of Peace", "Stranger in the Land of Shadows", "The Bastard King of Lyari", "Bullets and Roses", "The Jinn", "The Devil's Guardian", "The Butterfly Effect" and "Et tu Brutus".</i></b><br>

On 30 December 1999, Minister of External Affairs Devavrat Kapoor and Director of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) Ajay Sanyal negotiate with terrorist Zahoor Mistry to release three terrorists (including Mistry's brother) and pay a US$10 million ransom in exchange for the lives of airline passengers held captive in Kandahar. Though R&AW Special Secretary K. S. Bhullar rejects Sanyal's proposal to infiltrate terrorist networks in Pakistan, Kapoor later authorises Sanyal's covert "Operation Dhurandhar" following the 2001 Indian Parliament attack.<br>

Sanyal sends agent Hamza Ali Mazari into Pakistan via the Torkham border crossing in Afghanistan. In the Lyari suburb of Karachi, Hamza befriends Mohammed Aalam, a juice-shop owner, moves in with him, and works as a waiter while studying local gang politics. As a Baloch, Hamza can align only with the gang led by gangster Rehman Dakait and his cousin and deputy Uzair Baloch.<br>

Hamza learns that a rival Pathan gang, led by Rehman's estranged father Babu Dakait, plans to kill Rehman's eldest son Naieem Baloch. Babu's men attack a wedding attended by Naieem and his younger brother Faizal; Hamza saves Faizal, but Naieem is killed. At the hospital, Rehman and Uzair note Hamza's firearm skills and recruit him. Jameel Jamali of the Pakistan Awami Party (PAP) urges Uzair not to retaliate before the Lyari election, but Hamza encourages revenge. Rehman's gang massacres Babu's men, and Rehman personally kills Babu with a weighing stone, proclaiming Baloch dominance over Lyari.<br>

At a PAP rally, Hamza meets Jameel's daughter Yalina and begins a relationship with her. Rehman is introduced to Major Iqbal of the ISI by the Khanani brothers, businessmen who are pushing him into politics; Iqbal requests weapons and ammunition. Hamza learns about Iqbal's counterfeit-currency operation and witnesses him brutally torture an Indian spy. Hamza relays this information to Aalam, who informs Sanyal; the IB suspects Pakistan possesses Indian currency plates. While transporting weapons, Hamza uncovers plans for a major terror attack on India and alerts the IB.<br>

Rehman's alliance with the Khananis marginalises Jameel politically. Backed by Major Iqbal, Rehman enters politics and declares an alliance between his party the People's Aman Committee, and the PAP of Aquib Ali Zarwari. Jameel responds by recruiting suspended Superintendent of Police Chaudhary Aslam to eliminate Rehman, leading to the formation of the Lyari Task Force (LTF). Aslam arrests Rehman during a weapons run. Hamza counters by sending Jameel a video recorded by Yalina, exposing Jameel's collusion with Aslam and gangster Arshad Pappu. When Aslam refuses to release Rehman, Hamza forces compliance by livestreaming himself and Uzair torturing captured LTF officers.<br>

Despite Hamza's intelligence, the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack occurs. Traumatized, Hamza and Aalam resolve to dismantle Pakistan's terror infrastructure. Hamza secretly proposes to Jameel that by marrying Yalina, he will rule Lyari while granting Jameel lasting influence. He then conspires with Jameel and Aslam to eliminate Rehman. At Hamza and Yalina's wedding, Major Iqbal requests another weapons shipment. Exploiting Rehman's drunkenness, Hamza schedules the delivery to coincide with another engagement, creating an ambush opportunity. On the day of delivery, Hamza sends Uzair to the shipment site while driving Rehman to Aslam's trap. Rehman realises the betrayal mid-journey; a violent struggle follows, ending in a crash. Hamza escapes, kills two of Rehman's henchmen, and helps Aslam subdue Rehman, who later dies from his injuries in the hospital.<br>

Hamza's real identity is revealed to be Jaskirat Singh Rangi, an Indian death-row inmate turned covert operative for Ajay Sanyal. With Rehman eliminated, he consolidates power in Lyari and prepares to target "Bade Sahab", the architect of multiple Pakistani terror attacks.

The film was officially announced in July 2024 by Ranveer Singh and Aditya Dhar on their social media accounts. Initially conceived as a single film, the project was later split into two parts due to its scale and narrative complexity, with both instalments shot concurrently as a single project. Principal photography took place from July 2024 to October 2025 across India and Thailand.

The original plan was to release one long film, but the large amount of footage and story complexity led the makers to split it into two parts during post-production process. With the sequel scheduled for 19 March 2026.
