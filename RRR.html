<p>
During the British Raj in 1920, the oppressive Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine, visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, an artistically talented girl from the Gond tribe. Enraged, Bheem the tribe's guardian, Komaram Bheem, embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of Hyderabad warns Buxton office of the impending danger and advises them to return the child. Undeterred, Catherine enlists Alluri Sitarama "Ram" Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer, to quell the threat, promising a promotion should he capture Bheem alive or a bounty otherwise.<br>

Ram and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend a pro-independence gathering in disguise, where Bheem's aide Lachhu attempts to recruit them into Bheem's plot. On the way to Bheem's hideout, Lachhu discerns Ram's identity and flees. Shortly afterward, Ram and Bheem witness a child getting trapped by a train wreck and work together to rescue him. Unaware of their opposing allegiances, they form a close friendship.<br>

With Ram's help, Bheem courts an Englishwoman named Jenny, discovering that she is staying with the Buxtons. Following a party where Ram and Bheem out-dance the pompous English attendees, Jenny invites Bheem to her residence, where he finds Malli and promises to free her soon after. Meanwhile, Ram locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu sets a banded krait onto Ram and warns him of his imminent death, since the British have no antidote for its venom and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds. Bheem finds Ram, saves his life, and divulges his tribal identity and mission, unaware of Ram's true identity.<br>

That night, at an event to honour Governor Buxton, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a truck filled with wildlife; they maul Buxton's guards, creating havoc among the guests. Ram arrives and fights Bheem; Bheem is forced to stand down when Buxton holds Malli at gunpoint. Bheem is arrested and Ram is promoted.<br>

A flashback reveals that Ram's father Alluri Venkatarama Raju was a revolutionary who hoped to arm his village with British rifles, but was killed by British soldiers before he got the chance. Ram, who had promised his dying father that he would get guns to arm his village, subsequently left his village and his fiancée Sita to become a mole within the police - his promotion for having captured Bheem finally giving him access to the gun shipments. At Bheem's public flogging, Ram attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion, and further enlightening Ram, who realizes that Bheem's courage inspires people in a way that mere weapons cannot. He persuades Buxton to execute Bheem in secrecy in front of Malli while preparing an ambush to rescue both of them, but Buxton deduces the plan, and Ram is injured while rescuing Malli. Bheem, who mistakes Ram as trying to hurt Malli, bludgeons Ram and escapes with Malli. Ram is arrested for treason and imprisoned in solitary confinement.<br>

Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities. Sita, who had arrived there to collect Ram's body after his hanging, rescues them by claiming that the people there had smallpox, which deters the British officers. Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Ram's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Realising his folly, Bheem vows to save him.<br>

With Jenny's assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Ram is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they defeat soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine and a spear. Taking the fight to Buxton, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting it afire. Bheem steals a cache of guns for Ram before the barracks explode, killing many soldiers and Catherine. Cornering a wounded Buxton, Ram has Bheem execute Buxton with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem and Malli are reunited with their group. To mark the mission's successful completion, Ram asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Ram to provide education for him and his community. Raju and Sita return to their village with a cache of guns salvaged from the ruins of the barracks, and Bheem and his group return to Adilabad, where Malli is reunited with her mother.

<p><h2>Development</h2></p>
<p>
n October 2017, in an interview with Variety, S. S. Rajamouli announced two projects after Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) with producers D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment and K. L. Narayana. Rajamouli prioritised his work on the former, which was touted to be a social drama film, and which would be followed by Narayana's production with actor Mahesh Babu. In November 2017, Rajamouli shared a picture with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan through his social media handles, hinting their inclusion in the film.<br>

Rajamouli came across real-life stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends.<br>


The film was announced in March 2018, with the tentative title RRR, an abbreviation for Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Rama Rao. The tentative title RRR was later confirmed to be the film's official title as Rajamouli felt that a universal title across the languages was essential for a film of such scale. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria.<br>


Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad gave the original story and Rajamouli scripted the film, which he worked on for six months. In September 2018, writer Sai Madhav Burra was signed for the dialogues for the film in the primary language (Telugu), whereas dialogues in other versions were written by Madhan Karky (Tamil), Varadaraj Chikkaballapura (Kannada), Mamkombu Gopalakrishnan (Malayalam),[34] and Riya Mukherjee (Hindi).[35] Rajamouli retained several technicians from his previous projects. The crew consists of M. M. Keeravani as the music director, K. K. Senthil Kumar as the director of photography, A. Sreekar Prasad as the film editor, Sabu Cyril as the production designer, V. Srinivas Mohan handling the visual effects supervision, and Rama Rajamouli as the costume designer. Nick Powell was the stunt director for the film, and handled the choreography for the climax action sequences in the film. Prior to the start of film production, both Rama Rao and Charan had attended a special workshop in mid-November 2018, in order to train physically and intensively for their roles in the film.<br>


RRR is an entirely fictitious story incorporating the lives of two real-life Indian revolutionaries, namely Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad respectively. Charan plays Rama Raju while Rama Rao plays Komaram Bheem. The plot explores their stay in Delhi of the 1920s before they begin the fight for their country. Rajamouli stated that there had been a coincidence between the two Telugu tribal leaders and the events surrounding over them.<br>

<p>
When I read about Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, it was exciting to know that their story is similar. They never met each other. What if they had met? What if they had got inspired by each other? That is what RRR is about. It is completely fictitious. The film is mounted on a very large scale. We had to do a lot of research for it. To know costumes, their dialect, their way of living and that is why it took so much time for us to get this together.  <br>
